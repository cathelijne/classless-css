# Classless CSS

This is a list of classless CSS themes and frameworks.  "Classless" means a style sheet does not define special classes you must add to your HTML elements to style these elements.  As a result, you can style any plain-HTML page just by linking to the style sheet.  This is useful, for example, in prototyping.

## Class-light

These are frameworks that do not force you to apply their classes to many elements but require something like `<div class="container">` or a bit of your own CSS for a page to look right.  They may offer optional classes to style your content.
